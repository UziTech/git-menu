The easiest way to contribute to this package is to vote on new commmands. New commands are entered as issues with the [`command`](https://github.com/UziTech/context-git/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acommand) label. I will prioritize commands with the most :+1:'s

### Submit Commands

If there are commands you would like to see just create an issue with the command template and I will label it as a command.

### Submit An Issue

If you find a bug or just have a question about something create an issue and I will be happy to help you out.
